# VBA-challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 2 HW - VBA  
I used the following resource(s):  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/loop-through-data-using-macro  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.columnwidth  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/concepts/getting-started/using-ifthenelse-statements  
A lot of what I had to look up was syntax, which isn't surprising given how weird VBA is.
